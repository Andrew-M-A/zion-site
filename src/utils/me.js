  bio: "My career began in an unconventional way as a professional downhill skateboard racer. Traveling the world and competing at speeds over 60 mph, learning the importance of instinct, pattern recognition, and quick decision making skills. While pursuing this passion, I balanced my time with academics, earning an international finance degree and gaining experiences such as; living in Japan, working for Hewlett-Packard, and founding an equity analysis business.\n\nIt was during this entrepreneurial chapter that I became captivated by the technical challenges in business, where I took on problems such as automating data pipelines for equity reports and DCF models. This experience ignited my passion for technology and its ability to enhance problem-solving and creativity. To deepen my skills, I formalized my education through a coding bootcamp, contributed to open-source projects, and secured a role at a Series A startup in Los Angeles.\n\nToday, I focus on tackling challenges across the stack, DB, cloud infrastructure, AI integration, and CI/CD pipelines. Outside of work, youâ€™ll likely find me surfing or skating down hills, always driven by the same love for speed and creativity that started my journey.",
